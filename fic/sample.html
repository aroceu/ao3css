        <blockquote class="userstuff"><blockquote>
  <p><b>Prompt:</b> 3 - Missing scenes from the series<br>I'd love some 
frienship moments between Ink and Pran during the canon timeline. Pran 
could know or not about her feelings for Paa (we already know that Ink 
knew about Pran's feeling for Pat). Or it could be during fake PatPran 
break up era, planning double dates / outings with Pa and Paa, or even 
trying to meddle to get Korn and Wai together.</p>
  <p>Any rating is fine.<br>Since we're staying in canon, please stick 
to the happy ending of the series (you can go AU if you decide to write 
Korn and Wai getting together though).</p>
</blockquote><p>There's no Wai/Korn in this story, but they do make an appearance.</p><p>The title is from that Spice Girls song. You know the one.</p><p>Cynthia, I hope you enjoy!</p></blockquote>

    <h2 class="toc-heading">that's the way it is</h2>
    <div class="userstuff">
      <p>"Did you hear?" says a boy who might be one of Pran's friends. "Pat and Pran broke up."<br>
<br>
Ink blinks. "What?"<br>
<br>
"Yeah." The boy‚Äîwho might be named Louis, now that Ink is scouring her 
memory‚Äîhuffs, hands on his hips. "Wonder what Pat did. That bastard."<br>
<br>
"Hey," Ink says defensively. "Pat's my friend." Besides, Pa had waxed 
poetic to her about how Pat and Pran had a connection that no one else 
understood, not even her, ever since they were able to walk and 
talk.&nbsp;<em>Not like brothers</em>, Pa had clarified,&nbsp;<em>but like soulmates.&nbsp;</em>Ink hadn't thought that far when she had been making their matching bracelets; she'd just thought they were cute.<br>
<br>
Still, maybe-Louis crinkles his nose. "Well, Pran told us that they 
broke up," he says to Ink. "So one of them must've done something."<br>
<br>
"Sometimes people just break up," Ink says, but pulls out her phone anyway.<br>
<br>
<em>Pat and Pran broke up?</em><br>
<br>
<hr /><br>
<br>
Pa texts her back after her class:&nbsp;<em>WHAT??? üò≠ who else will put up with my brother like this üò≠</em><br>
<br>
Ink laughs as she heads toward the motorbike stand outside of the 
Faculty of Communication Arts campus. Today's one of her half days, in 
terms of class work. She'd usually have the photography club today too, 
but Au had called out due to a prior engagement and two of their 
freshmen are saddled with homework, so the club meeting had been 
canceled today. Typically Ink would set up a last minute shoot for Jam's
 newest line or wander around campus for interesting shots to take, but 
now with a girlfriend she wonders if she should prepare a hot bath and 
text Pa until she gets home.<br>
<br>
The fantasy gets interrupted when she gets a phone call‚Äînot from her girlfriend in question, but Pran.<br>
<br>
Ink answers. "Hello?"<br>
<br>
"Hey," says Pran. He doesn't sound heartbroken at all. "Are you busy?"<br>
<br>
"Not really," says Ink, pausing by the motorbike she was about to mount. "Why?"<br>
<br>
"Can you come over?" In the background, Ink can hear another voice. 
"It's fine, go to class," Pran says to someone else on the other end, 
before, "I mean, to my dorm. You know where Tinidee is, right?"<br>
<br>
"Yes, I've been to Pat and Pa's a bunch," Ink says with a laugh.<br>
<br>
"Oh, right," says Pran. "Well, do you want to‚Äîwe can hang out?"<br>
<br>
"Sure," says Ink. Her conversation with maybe-Louis floats through her brain again:&nbsp;<em>Pat and Pran broke up.&nbsp;</em>Somehow, a part of her doesn't believe that that's the full story.<br>
<br>
"Awesome," says Pran. "I'm dorm 439. You can use the stairs if the elevator doesn't work."<br>
<br>
To Ink's luck, the elevator does work when she arrives at Pran's 
apartment building. It doesn't take long for her to find Pran's 
dorm‚Äîright across from Pat and Pa's, which Pran had mentioned before, 
way back when his relationship with Pat had first become public. Ink 
hadn't forgotten, but it's another thing to come to the same part of the
 hallway to knock on a different apartment door, and be greeted by 
Pran's cautious smile when he opens it up.<br>
<br>
"Hey," he says. "That was fast."<br>
<br>
"I was on my way home anyway." Ink cheerfully puts her bag on Pran's 
kitchen counter and glances around. Two cups and two plates on the sink;
 a black leather bag that doesn't seem to be Pran's style hanging from a
 stand. The bedroom door is closed, and several stacks of engineering 
textbooks are on Pran's desk.<br>
<br>
Closing the door behind them, Pran fidgets. "Make yourself at home," he says.<br>
<br>
Ink does, sitting herself on the sofa and smiling up at Pran. "So what's up?" she asks.<br>
<br>
She hadn't seen Pran since before break, when he and Pat supposedly ran 
away together. Pa had called her in a panic and Ink had calmed her down 
then; later, Pat had texted Pa letting her know that he and Pran were 
gone for a bit, but okay. Ink had thought something happened, but 
certainly not a break up.<br>
<br>
Pran fidgets again. Then he sits on the couch next to Ink.<br>
<br>
"When Pat and I were born," he starts.<br>
<br>
"Is this about your breakup?"<br>
<br>
"What? No." Pran looks alarmed. Then, realizing what he said, "Yes. Wait, no. Well, it's‚ÄîI mean‚Äîwhen we were born‚Äî"<br>
<br>
"Yes, yes, you're star-crossed lovers and all," says Ink, waving a hand.
 "Your parents hate each other, your friends hate each other, you can't 
stay away from each other. Pa's already told me all that."<br>
<br>
"Oh." Pran looks embarrassed. "Really?"<br>
<br>
Ink gives him a look. "I'm dating her, aren't I?"<br>
<br>
"Right," says Pran. "Well, Pat and I‚Äîour parents don't approve of us. Right now. So we're broken up."<br>
<br>
Ink waits.<br>
<br>
"But," Pran continues. "Not really. It's just what we told most of our 
friends, and our families, so they'd get off our backs. We're still, you
 know." He bites his lip like he's trying not to smile. "Dating."<br>
<br>
Ink had seen it in his eyes when they were in high school, a quiet sort 
of longing that she wrote her own stories about in her head. It was why 
she had made those bracelets, after all. Yet, seeing Pran's affections 
fruition in real time in front of her eyes is another experience 
entirely, one she knows for herself even now, when she feels a string of
 buzzes from her phone inside her pocket, surely full of emojis and 
punctuation marks.<br>
<br>
"So," says Ink. "How can I help?"<br>
<br>
<hr /><br>
<br>
When she gets back to the dorm across the hallway‚Äîcrossing paths with 
Pat as well, who smirks at her before calling loudly into the apartment 
behind her, "Where's my good afternoon kiss?"‚ÄîPa enters only a few 
minutes later, both grumpy and relieved when she sees Ink lounging on 
her bed. "My brother bet that he'd get back before me, but I didn't even
 want to race," she says, dropping her bag and immediately joining Ink 
on the bed. "At least he doesn't come here anymore."<br>
<br>
"I was wondering where he's been the past few nights," Ink says thoughtfully, stroking Pa's hair.<br>
<br>
Pa looks guiltily up at her. "Pran told you?"<br>
<br>
"Yes." Ink tugs on her hair a little, then kisses the top of her head. "I can't believe you didn't tell me."<br>
<br>
"It wasn't my secret to tell! Plus, it's only been a few days," says Pa.<br>
<br>
Ink goes back to running her fingers through the long dark strands on Pa's shoulders. "Who else knows?" she asks.<br>
<br>
"Korn and Wai."<br>
<br>
Ink raises her eyebrows. "And?"<br>
<br>
"There's no one else," says Pa. "Hia told me as soon as he and Pran had 
come back. I don't know if they told their friends yet. I didn't know if
 they wanted to tell you, but I promise I won't keep any secrets 
anymore!" She sticks her lower lip out.<br>
<br>
Ink can't resist leaning in to kiss that lower lip. "It's fine, I 
understand," she says. "And I have a feeling they told their friends 
already."<br>
<br>
Pa cuddles close to her. "I'm glad we don't have to hide our relationship," she says. "And that they're still dating."<br>
<br>
"Oh?" says Ink, pretending not to noticing Pa resting more of her weight on her. "Why?"<br>
<br>
Pa flutters her eyelashes at her. "So we can have this dorm to 
ourselves," she says, and turns so she's straddling Ink's lap, and then 
they're not doing much talking anymore.<br>
<br>
<hr /><br>
<br>
It all clicks in Ink's brain a few mornings later when Pat is running 
back and forth between dorms to make sure he has everything for a class 
presentation. "We're going to breakfast," Pa announces from the doorway,
 as Pat digging under his bed for something.<br>
<br>
He glances at their joint hands‚Äîonly for a second‚Äîbut says, "Have fun," to them before returning back under his bed.<br>
<br>
It's been a while since he and Pran had left together like that, Ink realizes.<br>
<br>
Pran smiles at them in the hallway. "Bye," he says, as Ink and Pa leave, but he seems contemplative too.<br>
<br>
Later, Ink finds him skulking right outside the Communication Arts 
campus‚Äîthough it's not too much of a surprise, as it's right beside the 
Architecture buildings. "Hey," says Ink, coming up to him.<br>
<br>
Pran looks shocked, but Ink says, "Don't pretend, I know you were waiting for me."<br>
<br>
Pran deflates. "How could you tell?" he asks.<br>
<br>
"A woman's intuition," Ink replies. When Pran scoffs, she adds, "Also, 
I've been paying attention to you since high school. If you haven't 
noticed."<br>
<br>
"Really? Why? Do you have a crush on me or something?" Pran teases.<br>
<br>
Ink elbows him and laughs. "No, but I know who&nbsp;<em>you</em>&nbsp;have a crush on," she says, grinning. "I've known for a while."<br>
<br>
Doubt crosses Pran's face. "Is it that obvious?"<br>
<br>
"Well," says Ink, linking her arm with Pran's. Pran lets her, though 
there's a tangible stiffness in the way he holds himself around her. 
"Only if you have an eye for these things. Which I do." She gestures to 
her camera around her neck. "I notice everything."<br>
<br>
Pran rolls his eyes, but relaxes at that. "Sure," he says.<br>
<br>
"So what brings you here?" says Ink. "Aren't you afraid of people seeing you with me, Pat's friend?"<br>
<br>
"You're my friend too, right?" says Pran.<br>
<br>
Ink pretends to be flattered. "I am?"<br>
<br>
Pran laughs at her. "Stop," he says, though with his arm still linked 
with hers, he tugs her closer. "No, I mean, you are. But I am here to," 
he pauses, "ask for a favor."<br>
<br>
"What kind of favor?"<br>
<br>
Pran considers for a moment. "Pat doesn't like keeping secrets," he says
 finally. "Especially about our relationship. He's a lot better about it
 now, but I know if he had the choice..."<br>
<br>
Ink remembers the few weeks before break, after the Architecture play, 
over hotpot and hospital beds and apparent public confessions. She nods.
 "That makes sense," she says.<br>
<br>
"He misses it," says Pran, except the wistfulness of his tone sounds like he's saying,&nbsp;<em>we miss it.&nbsp;</em>"I was wondering if, you know. You had any ideas."<br>
<br>
It's a pretty weird ask, but conveniently being a communication arts 
student comes with some perks, including access and reservations to 
rooms that would be perfect date spots. "You guys wanna go out, huh?" 
she asks.<br>
<br>
Pran doesn't even try to deny it. "Stay at home dates are nice and all,"
 he says, "but there's only so much we can do before it gets boring. 
Other people don't have to see us."<br>
<br>
"But you don't want to be trapped at home together forever," Ink finishes.<br>
<br>
Pran nods.<br>
<br>
Ink straightens her back. Her and Pran's arms are still looped, and she brings him in tighter.<br>
<br>
"Well," she says. "Good thing you came to this side of campus, because there's a little movie theater I want to show you."<br>
<br>
<hr /><br>
<br>
It takes perhaps a bit of heavy lifting and light bribery, but all things considered, it's not&nbsp;<em>that&nbsp;</em>much
 effort for Ink to reserve the entire Communication Arts theater 
building for one evening, including the concession booths and the 
control booth. Her wallet will cry a bit for the dinner she buys for the
 staff next weekend, but at least she gets an excuse to spend more time 
with her girlfriend.<br>
<br>
Pran and Pat pick out a movie Ink finds in the film archives, and stroll
 in together like they're at a real movie theater. "Two tickets, 
please," Pat says, hand entwined with Pran's.<br>
<br>
Korn looks up from the table. "That'll be 400 baht," he says.<br>
<br>
Pat frowns. "Korn, you can't possibly expect me to‚Äî"<br>
<br>
"400 baht," says Wai from next to him.<br>
<br>
"Are you guys even going to give the money to the film club?" asks Ink.<br>
<br>
Both Korn and Wai look at her. "No," they say at the same time.<br>
<br>
Pat gives Ink a pleading look, but she shrugs. Then he turns to Pran, 
who's badly disguising the smile on his face and nods to their friends. 
"You heard them," he says. "400 baht."<br>
<br>
"I didn't mean it when I said I'd pay," Pat complains, but digs out his 
wallet anyway and hands Korn his money. "I thought this was for&nbsp;<em>free</em>‚Äî"<br>
<br>
"You can get something else for free later," Pran says, as they walk off to the theater.<br>
<br>
Once they're gone, Korn gets up from the table. "I'm gonna go steal some snacks, " he says.<br>
<br>
"No, you're not," says Ink. "You pay for whatever you eat."<br>
<br>
Korn pouts. "Do I look like I'm made of money?"<br>
<br>
"You look like you're made of idiot," Wai chimes in.<br>
<br>
"That doesn't make sense!" says Korn.<br>
<br>
"<em>You</em>&nbsp;don't make sense," Wai says. "Come on, let's go get a drink."<br>
<br>
"Thanks for helping, you guys," Ink says sarcastically, and Wai just gives her a salute before dragging Korn out.<br>
<br>
Ink nabs some juice and drinks from the concession stand (more for her 
wallet to cry about later) before going into the control room where Pa's
 already loaded up the movie. "My brother's disgusting when he's in 
love," she says, gesturing down below the booth where two figures are 
visibly sitting so close together that it's hard to make out two heads 
from one.<br>
<br>
"And you're not?" says Ink, setting the food down before wrapping an arm around her. "Let's see, did you do this correctly?"<br>
<br>
"It's different when it's us! And yes, I did," Pa says proudly. "The movie's playing already."<br>
<br>
Ink hums and double checks, but Pa's telling the truth‚Äîshe did put the 
film in exactly how Ink had shown her earlier. "What do you know, you 
did," she says, and Pa preens at the praise. "My little student is all 
grown up now."<br>
<br>
Pa laughs. "Oh, so that's how you think of me?" she says. "As your student?"<br>
<br>
"Yes," says Ink, crowding her close. "My very cute student."<br>
<br>
"I don't think that's appropriate,&nbsp;<em>teacher</em>," says Pa, 
though makes no move to push her away even as Ink's hand reaches around 
to touch her behind. "Neither is that, I think."<br>
<br>
"Hmm," says Ink, and kisses Pa's nose, then her mouth. "What about this?"<br>
<br>
"Definitely not," Pa mumbles, before her noises get lost in the darkness of the booth.<br>
<br>
<hr /><br>
<br>
As it turns out, hiding your friends' relationship is not the hardest 
thing in the world, especially when you have three people hiding it with
 you. Even moreso when most of hiding their relationship is just 
coordinating schedules and coming up with fabrications as to why Pran's 
friends can't go to a noodle shop while Pat and Pran are on a lunch date
 there, or how come Pat can't go home during Songkran, in case anyone 
asks.<br>
<br>
Pa takes Ink home to visit her family, though, during the New Year, 
while Pat is conveniently ill and Pran has such a big project that he 
can't go home at the same time, at least not for the entire holiday. Ink
 has met Pa's family in passing before, but not like this‚Äî"Mom, Dad, 
this is my," says Pa, trying not to look nervous. "My girlfriend."<br>
<br>
Ink bows at them. "It's nice to meet you," she says politely.<br>
<br>
"Oh, stop, you can call me&nbsp;<em>Ma</em>," says Pa's mother, dragging
 her in for a hug. "If you want. Is this why you've barely called us at 
all, Pa?" she asks her daughter. "Because you're so busy with your new 
girlfriend?"<br>
<br>
"Ma," Pa whines, in a way that's always made Ink's heart flutter.<br>
<br>
Her father is more formal, looking over Ink critically. Ink knows that 
this is the father who'd always been obsessive over Pat's life, up until
 recently, as Pa had told her. With Ink, though, he nods approvingly and
 says, "You were Pat's classmate in high school, weren't you?"<br>
<br>
"Yes," says Ink, surprised. "I didn't know you'd remember me."<br>
<br>
"I remember you were a good student," says Pa's father. "I thought‚Äî" and
 then he stops, like he suddenly realized what he was about to say.<br>
<br>
Ink doesn't ask, and their Songkran dinner goes well, a massive table of
 dishes for only four people. "I wish hia was here, he could eat so much
 of this," Pa says, halfway through her fish.<br>
<br>
"You'd just complain about him eating&nbsp;<em>too</em>&nbsp;much," Ink points out.<br>
<br>
Pa's parents laugh while Pa whines at her until Ink kisses the top of 
her head. Her parents glance at each other at the mention of Pat, but 
say nothing; Ink feels much closer to him than before now. She and Pa 
know something about him that their parents don't. Ink wonders if Pat 
and Pa had talked together about whether to tell her at all.<br>
<br>
Ink's stay at her girlfriend's house for the holiday gets more 
complicated when Pran visits his family the next day and the three of 
them steal away to the ice cream shop at the end of the block late 
morning. "How's Pat?" Ink asks him, while Pa orders at the counter. "Is 
he still 'sick'?"<br>
<br>
Pran rolls his eyes, but something's still thoughtful about his gaze. 
"He really doesn't want to see his father," he tells Ink. "Not just 
because of us."<br>
<br>
Though Ink's curiosity is piqued, she doesn't press. "That's 
understandable," she says. "I'm glad you're still on good terms with 
your parents."<br>
<br>
"Yeah, well." Pran lifts a shoulder, drops it. "It's not as easy for me to be otherwise."<br>
<br>
"It's probably not easy for Pat, either."<br>
<br>
Pran exhales through his nose. "Yeah," he agrees.<br>
<br>
With their ice creams, they stand outside the shop and Pran and Pa try 
not to look too friendly with each other, with Ink standing in between 
them. "Our parents suck," says Pa, taking a lick of her ice cream. (Ink 
tries not to stare.) "We should be going on double dates together. You 
make my brother more fun, Pran."<br>
<br>
"Really?" Pran says, with a little laugh. "I think I make him more insufferable."<br>
<br>
"Yeah, but you're the only one who really has to put up with it," says 
Pa, and Ink hides a laugh behind her vanilla ice cream. "Plus, wouldn't 
it be fun?"<br>
<br>
"It would," Pran agrees. "Our parents do suck."<br>
<br>
"Hey," says Ink. "It's not&nbsp;<em>that&nbsp;</em>impossible, is it?"<br>
<br>
Pa and Pran turn to her. "Our parents don't even want&nbsp;<em>us</em>&nbsp;to hang out," Pa reminds her, gesturing at herself and Pran. "So yeah, it's impossible."<br>
<br>
"And you haven't met my mom," says Pran.<br>
<br>
A thought occurs to Ink. "She hasn't met me," she points out to Pran. 
"Your friend. Who also happens to be dating your secret boyfriend's 
sister." She gestures to Pa.<br>
<br>
Pa and Pran make quick work to hush her. "Shh, someone could hear!" says Pa, while Pran glances around suspiciously.<br>
<br>
Ink resists the urge to roll her eyes. "Okay, fine. I'm your friend, who
 also has a girlfriend," she says. "Who has a brother." She raises her 
eyebrows pointedly.<br>
<br>
A look of understanding flashes across Pran's face. "That might not be 
enough though," he says, as Pa seems to still be thinking it over. "I 
mean, just because we're friends doesn't mean we can just hang out like 
that. All of us, I mean."<br>
<br>
Ink sighs. "Do you want to go on public dates with your boyfriend that look like double dates or not?"<br>
<br>
"Oh!" says Pa, finally understanding. "If people just think you're out 
with your girlfriend," she gestures to herself, "and your friend," to 
Pran.<br>
<br>
"And my other friend," says Ink.<br>
<br>
"Who's my brother," adds Pa.<br>
<br>
"You don't have to make it sound so convoluted," says Pran.<br>
<br>
Ink turns to him. "Well, what will you tell your mom when she asks?"<br>
<br>
"Why would she ask?"<br>
<br>
"Because you want to go on double dates," says Pa, in a way that sounds like,&nbsp;<em>I want to go on double dates</em>. "Plus, she's gonna see Ink sooner or later‚Äîshe could walk down the street right now."<br>
<br>
"Oh," says Pran, furrowing his eyebrows for a moment. Then he meets Ink's eyes. "Fine. Then you should meet my mom. Today."<br>
<br>
"Fine," Ink echoes.<br>
<br>
"Now?" Pa asks skeptically.<br>
<br>
Pran finishes off his ice cream‚Äîhe'd eaten it relatively quickly, with Ink and Pa still halfway done. "For lunch," he says.<br>
<br>
"I'll have you know that parents love me," Ink says, her chin raised.<br>
<br>
"Pran's mom is scary," Pa warns her. "She yelled at me once when my bike crossed the line between our houses. I was eight."<br>
<br>
"Well, you're not exactly an obedient girl, are you?" Ink says, cuffing 
her head and smiling. "Don't worry about me, moms like me especially."<br>
<br>
So for lunch, after Pran texts her,&nbsp;<em>I told my parents so they'll make enough food for you</em>, and then,<em>&nbsp;You can come any time after noon,&nbsp;</em>Ink
 arrives at 12:05 on the dot, not even pretending that she‚Äôs not walking
 over from next door. Pran opens the door, and Ink spots his wary smile 
for a brief moment before his mother appears, with an apron and a look 
of delight on her face.<br>
<br>
"Oh, you must be Pran's friend!" she says. "It's been a while since Pran
 invited any new friends over, we're so glad to have you for Songkran!"<br>
<br>
"Thank you for your hospitality," Ink says with a bright smile, bowing. "Oh, it smells delicious inside. Is that&nbsp;<em>gaeng hung lay</em>?"<br>
<br>
"I like your friend already," Pran's mother declares. "What's your name again?"<br>
<br>
"Ink," says Ink. Much like Pa's mother, instead of bowing or shaking her
 hand, Pran's mom drags her in for an enthusiastic hug. "Pran and I used
 to be classmates in high school, and now we're classmates in college."<br>
<br>
"Perfect. You can call me Dissaya," says Pran's mother. "Pran, you 
should've told me you had a friend who knew northern dishes, I would've 
made more."<br>
<br>
"I didn't know," says Pran, mildly bewildered. He looks pleased though, and Ink smirks at him when Dissaya isn't looking.<br>
<br>
"Don't you remember?" Ink says. "I'm from up north, of course I know all the dishes from there."<br>
<br>
"Of course, of course," says Dissaya, ushering her in. "Well, we have 
plenty of food for you. And you can meet my husband. Honey!"<br>
<br>
Lunch with Pran's family is as easy as dinner was with Pat and Pa's, 
with Ink making easy conversation with Pran and his parents. Pran 
doesn't seem entirely happy though, which Ink resolves to ask him about 
later; she doubts it has anything to do with her, with the few times she
 caught Pran lost in thought. Luckily his parents don't seem to notice, 
and Ink compliments everything on the table until it looks like Dissaya 
is going to burst with pride.<br>
<br>
Then she mentions, very casually, "If my girlfriend was here, she wouldn't be able to handle this much spice."<br>
<br>
She pretends not to notice Dissaya and her husband's double take at this. "Oh? Your girlfriend?" Dissaya asks.<br>
<br>
Ink nods. "I think you know her? She lives right next door."<br>
<br>
Realization dawns on Dissaya's face. "You," she says, then stops and turns to her son. "Pran?"<br>
<br>
Pran shrugs half-heartedly. "I didn't know," he says.<br>
<br>
Ink watches as Pran's parents glance at each other, then back to Ink. Then to each other again.<br>
<br>
Then Dissaya takes a deep breath and smiles. "I'm glad to hear you have a
 girlfriend," she says. Out of the corner of Ink's eye, she sees the 
relief wash over Pran's face, if only for a moment. "Our poor Pran just 
went through a breakup recently, so I'm glad he has a friend like you 
around."<br>
<br>
She pauses like there's something else she wants to say, but doesn't 
continue. Ink almost wants to dare her to say something about Pa.<br>
<br>
"I heard," Ink says after a moment. "I'm glad, too. I think Pran just wants to be with someone<em>&nbsp;he&nbsp;</em>chooses to be with, don't you?"<br>
<br>
Dissaya smiles, but instead of answering, asks, "Do you want more rice?"<br>
<br>
Ink goes back to Pa's house afterward. Shortly after dinner, Pran texts her.<br>
<br>
<em>My parents wanted me to ask if you had other friends you could introduce me to.&nbsp;</em><br>
<br>
Ink laughs, as Pa pokes her to ask for her opinion on an internship she's looking at on her laptop. Ink texts back,&nbsp;<em>Why, is there a certain friend you want to meet?</em><br>
<br>
<em>We could always go for hot pot</em>, Pran suggests.<br>
<br>
<hr /><br>
<br>
They do, with Ink on a date with her girlfriend and her friend and her 
girlfriend's brother, a few weeks afterward once they‚Äôve figured out 
their real schedules together, not just their fake ones. When they tell 
Wai and Korn, Korn asks, "Why can't it be a triple date?"<br>
<br>
"With who?" says Wai. "Us?"<br>
<br>
"Duh."<br>
<br>
"We're not dating!"<br>
<br>
Ink's not really complaining about the lack of Wai and Korn when the 
four of them get in the booth though, Pat and Pran on one side, and Ink 
taking the window as Pa slides in next to her. "It's fine," Ink says, as
 both Pran and even Pat glance around surreptitiously every once in a 
while. "No one's paying attention."<br>
<br>
"Yeah," says Pa. "And even if they did, you guys aren't&nbsp;<em>really</em>&nbsp;on a date."<br>
<br>
"But we are," says Pat, and after looking around again, sneaking a kiss 
on Pran's neck. Pran yelps and smacks him off. "And so are you two."<br>
<br>
"We're all on a friend date," Ink says diplomatically. "Except for me and Pa."<br>
<br>
"That's right," Pat says to Pran again. "<em>Friend</em>."<br>
<br>
Pran pushes at his face. "Don't get it twisted, we're hardly friends," 
he says to Pat, though there's an undeniable smile in his voice. "I'm 
just spending time with my good friend Ink."<br>
<br>
They all laugh. Pat picks up a well-cooked piece of beef and feeds it to
 Pran, who accepts; Ink does the same to Pa, with a piece of shrimp. 
"Normal friend behavior, I see," Pa says through chewing her shrimp, 
watching Pat, who‚Äôs trying to bite the piece of meat out from Pran's 
mouth.<br>
<br>
"Definitely normal," says Ink. She pecks Pa's mouth when she's done. "Mm, shrimp."<br>
<br>
"You know," Pran says to Pat, several minutes into their meal. "Wai and 
Korn are thinking of opening up a bar together. Do you think they'll 
need our help?"<br>
<br>
Pat's eyebrows flicker at this. "Both of ours?"<br>
<br>
Pran glances at Ink and Pa. "All of ours," he says. "It sure would suck if we had to spend more time together, wouldn't it?"<br>
<br>
Pa says, "It would if I have to spend more time with you guys! Sheesh."<br>
<br>
Ink giggles. "Aren't you the one who wanted to go on double dates with your brother?" she asks.<br>
<br>
Pat perks up and puts his chin on his hand. "Oh? Do I really have such a sentimental sister?"<br>
<br>
"Shut up," Pa grumbles, but doesn't protest when Ink ruffles her hair in
 affection, and opens up her mouth expectantly when Ink plucks out 
another piece of shrimp. "Why do I do anything for you," she says to 
Pat, who's still grinning at her over the table.<br>
<br>
"Because you love me," Pat answers without hesitation.<br>
<br>
Ink glances at Pran, and Pran looks back at her. They don't say anything, but smile; and Ink knows that he feels the same.</p>
